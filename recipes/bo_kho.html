    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vietnamese bò kho (beef stew) is packed with tender, fall-apart braised chunks of beef loaded with herbs, 
        aromatics and a delicious broth that will have you coming back with more Vietnamese baguette!</p> 
        
    <p>Similar to thịt kho, this slow braise / stew is easy to make, and the longer you cook it the softer the meat gets. 
        It’s an incredibly satisfying meal very accessible to both Vietnamese and American folks. This recipe is pretty hard to mess up in the kitchen.</p>

    <p>This was one of the popular dishes at my mom’s old restaurant because of its familiarity and accessibility, 
        and something I had often there, in between bottomless icy coconut drinks and fountain sodas.</p>

        <li>1.5 tbs fresh ginger sliced or pounded</li>

        <li>1 can chicken broth about 2 cups</li>
        <li>6 oz coconut soda, Coke, or Sprite</li>
        <li>5 cups filtered water or enough to barely cover the ingredients</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots cut into 1" chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Accoutrement</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 12" Vietnamese bread loaves</li>
        <li>2 sliced jalapenos</li>
        <li>1 sliced lemon</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Clean the meat. Add beef to a large pot and add 1 tbsp salt and enough tap water to barely cover the meat. 
            Bring to a boil on high heat, and once it hits a boil for 30 seconds, kill the heat, drain, and rinse under running water to clean. 
            If you haven't cut the meat into 3/4 - 1" pieces yet, do it now.</p></li>
        <li><p>Marinate the meat. Add all marinade ingredients to the meat in a covered bowl or a bag for at least two hours, 
            but overnight would be better.</p></li>
        <li><p>Aromatics. Preheat a large pot on medium high. When hot, add the oil, let it warm a bit, then add all the garlic and stir to 
            slowly saute until it turns light brown. Then add the paprika an stir until it releases its aroma, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Broth. Add all broth ingredients to the pot except the carrots. Turn the heat to high until it hits a boil, then reduce heat so it maintains a low boil. 
            Cook until the meat is as tender as you'd like it, about 60-90 minutes. Add carrots towards the final 10 minutes so it softens. 
            Discard the cooked onions and star anise pods.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with accoutrement as shown: tearing fresh Thai basil onto your plate, 
            taking occasional bites of jalapeno, and dipping a few pieces of meat into the salt / pepper / lemon juice side for variety.</p></li>
    </ol>
